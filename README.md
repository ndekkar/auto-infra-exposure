## Multi-Hazard Infrastructure Exposure Pipeline

This project implements a multi-hazard exposure assessment pipeline for critical infrastructure (e.g., power lines and substations). It processes geospatial data from various hazards such as floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires, earthquakes, and landslides, and generates both analytical outputs and maps.

## Features

- Multi-hazard exposure analysis (flood, landslide, earthquake, drought, wildfire, heat)
- Configurable via a single YAML file
- Infrastructure exposure for both point and line features
- Automated map generation for each hazard
